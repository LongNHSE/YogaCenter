* Vinyasa or flow yoga is among the most popular forms of yoga today, yet it may seem intimidating to newcomers to the fitness scene. The Vinyasa style is characterized by a continuous flow of poses, similar to a dance or tai chi. The postures and transitions are linked together with the breath, so often each pose immediately flows to the next. This fast-paced style of yoga differs from more traditional styles of yoga, which focus on holding each pose in a steady, static position. Vinyasa is a dynamic and high-energy practice that builds heat in the body, develops strength, and stimulates the cardiovascular system.
