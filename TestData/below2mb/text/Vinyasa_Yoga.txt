Jivamukti yoga

Jivamukti Yoga is a contemporary style of yoga that incorporates physical postures (asanas), breath control (pranayama), meditation, ethical principles, and philosophical teachings. It was developed by Sharon Gannon and David Life in the early 1980s and has gained popularity for its holistic approach to yoga practice.

Key features of Jivamukti Yoga include:

Physical Asanas: Jivamukti classes typically involve a dynamic and vigorous sequence of yoga poses, designed to improve flexibility, strength, and balance. The sequences are often accompanied by music and may vary in intensity from class to class.

Spiritual Focus: Jivamukti Yoga places a strong emphasis on the spiritual aspect of yoga. Each class usually begins with a theme that is explored through teachings, chanting, and guided meditation. These themes often draw from ancient yogic texts, philosophy, and ethical principles.

Ethical Guidelines: The practice of Jivamukti Yoga is guided by a set of ethical principles, which include compassion for all living beings, environmental consciousness, and a commitment to non-violence (ahimsa).
